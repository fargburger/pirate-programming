0. Read Chapter 1 of The Turing Omnibus on Algorithms
1. Rewrite the following algorithm as MUTINY
```
               ROYAL_NAVY
1. initialize_screen(sea, sky, boat, british_flag)
2. loop forever
   1. event = wait_for_event
   2. if event = click 
      1. print "The sun never sets on Her Royal Majesty's navy"     
   3. else if event = close
      1. break loop
```

in MUTINY, when the click even is invoked, instead of printing some lame thing, add steps to lower the `british_flag` and raise the `jolly_roger` 

2. clone this github repository
3. install pygame `pip install pygame`
4. run `python hoist_the_jolly_roger.py`
5. examine the source code, write a comment 
 ```# THIS IS A COMMENT```
   in front of every line of code explaining what the next line might be for
6. copy and rewrite royal_navy.py as muninty.py (on click event will bring down the british flag and raise the pirate flag)
